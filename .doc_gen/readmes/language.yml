running_code:
- scenario: "The easiest way to interact with this example code is by invoking a [Scenario](#Scenarios) from your command line. For example, `ruby some_scenario.rb` will invoke `some_scenario.rb`."
  no_scenario: "The easiest way to interact with this example code is by invoking [Single Actions](#single-actions) from your command line. This may require some modification to override hard-coded values, and some actions also expect runtime parameters. For example, `ruby some_action.rb ARG1 ARG2` will invoke `some_action.rb` with two arguments."
tests:
- minitest: "This service is currently tested using `minitest` and each test must be invoked individually from the command line. For example, `ruby some_test.rb` will invoke `some_test.rb`."
  rspec: "This service is currently tested using `rspec` and tests can be invoked from the command line either individually (`rspec some_spec.rb`) or all at once (`rspec .`)."
  no_tests: "This service is not currently tested."
