# SQS code examples for the SDK for Ruby
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues using the SDK for Ruby.

SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

### Scenarios
Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* [Working with dead letter queues](./sqs-ruby-example-dead-letter-queue.rb)

* [Working with messages](./sqs-ruby-example-send-receive-messages.rb)

* [Working with queues](./sqs-ruby-example-using-queues.rb)





## Run the examples

### Prerequisites
