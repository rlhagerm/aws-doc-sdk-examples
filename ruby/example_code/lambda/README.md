# Lambda code examples for the SDK for Ruby
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage AWS Lambda functions using the SDK for Ruby.

Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Create a function](lambda_basics.rb) (`CreateFunction`)

* [Delete a function](lambda_basics.rb) (`DeleteFunction`)

* [Get a function](lambda_basics.rb) (`GetFunction`)

* [Invoke a function](lambda_basics.rb) (`Invoke`)

* [List functions](lambda_basics.rb) (`ListFunctions`)

* [Update function code](lambda_basics.rb) (`UpdateFunctionCode`)

* [Update function configuration](lambda_basics.rb) (`UpdateFunctionConfiguration`)



### Scenarios
Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* [Get started with functions](scenario_getting_started_functions.rb)





## Run the examples

### Prerequisites

See the [Ruby README.md](../../../ruby/README.md) for prerequisites.

### Instructions
The easiest way to interact with this example code is by invoking a [Scenario](#Scenarios) from your command line. For example, `ruby some_scenario.rb` will invoke `some_scenario.rb`.

## Contributing
