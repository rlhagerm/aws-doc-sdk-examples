# EventBridge code examples for the SDK for Ruby
## Overview
These examples show how to create and manage Amazon EventBridge event buses using the SDK for Ruby.

EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account. 
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege). 
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Single actions
Code excerpts that show you how to call individual service functions.

* [Create a job](./create_job.rb) (`CreateJob`)



### Scenarios
Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling multiple functions within the same service.

* [Use Amazon EventBridge to write EC2 instance activity to Amazon SNS](./cw-ruby-example-send-events-ec2.rb)
