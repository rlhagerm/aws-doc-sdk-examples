# CloudWatch code examples for the SDK for .NET

## Overview
The code examples in this section show how to use the AWS SDK for .NET with Amazon CloudWatch to manage custom metrics and alarms.

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), IT managers, and product owners. CloudWatch provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, and optimize resource utilization.

## ⚠️ Important
* Running this code might result in charges to your AWS account.
* Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.
* We recommend that you grant your code least privilege. At most, grant only the minimum permissions required to perform the task. For more information, see [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege).
* This code is not tested in every AWS Region. For more information, see [AWS Regional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services).

## Code examples

### Scenarios

Code examples that show you how to accomplish a specific task by calling
multiple functions within the same service.

* [Get started with billing, alarms, and metrics](Scenarios/CloudWatchScenario.cs)

## Run the examples

### Prerequisites
* To find prerequisites for running these examples, see the
  [README](../README.md#Prerequisites) in the dotnetv3 folder.

### Get started with billing, alarms, and metrics

To enable billing metrics and statistics for this example, make sure
[billing alerts are enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html#turning_on_billing_metrics) for your account.

This interactive scenario runs at a command prompt and shows you how to use
Amazon CloudWatch with the AWS SDK for .NET to do the following:

1. List CloudWatch namespaces.
1. List CloudWatch metrics.
1. Get statistics for a CloudWatch metric.
1. Get statistics for estimated billing.
1. Create a CloudWatch dashboard with example widgets. 
1. Get information about current CloudWatch dashboards.
1. Create and add data to a custom metric.
1. Update the dashboard with the new metric.
1. Create a CloudWatch alarm for the metric.
1. Describe current alarms.
1. Get recent data for the metric.
1. Add data to trigger the alarm.
1. Wait for an alarm state.
1. Get alarm history.
1. Add an anomaly detector.
1. Describe current anomaly detectors.
1. Get and display a metric image.
1. Clean up resources.

Before you compile the .NET application, you can optionally set configuration values in the `settings.json` file.
These settings include your account and topic settings for sending an email from your alarm.
Alternatively, add a `settings.local.json` file with your local settings, which will be loaded automatically 
when the application runs.

After the example compiles, you can run it from the command line. To do so,
navigate to the folder that contains the .csproj file and run the following
command:

```
dotnet run
```

Alternatively, you can run the example from within your IDE.

## Tests

⚠ Running the tests might result in charges to your AWS account.

To find instructions for running these tests, see the [README](../README.md#Tests)
in the `dotnetv3` folder.
