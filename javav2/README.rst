AWS SDK for Java 2.0 documentation examples
###########################################

These are examples for the `AWS SDK for Java public documentation <javasdk-docs_>`_.

Prerequisites
=============

To build and run these examples, you need the following:

* `Apache Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`_ (>3.0)
* `AWS SDK for Java <https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/>`_ (downloaded and extracted somewhere on
  your machine)
* **All Java Version 2 examples assume that you have setup your credentials in the credentials file in the .aws folder**. For information about how to set AWS credentials and the AWS Region, see `Set up AWS credentials and Region for development <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html>`_ in the *AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide*. You should also set the *AWS Region* within which the operations will be performed. If a Region is not set, the default Region used is **us-east-1**. 
  
  After you set your AWS credentails in the credentials file located in the .aws folder, you can create a service client like this.
  
           Region region = Region.US_WEST_2;
         
           S3Client s3 = S3Client.builder()
             .region(region)
             .build();


**Note**: For more information about setting your AWS credentials, see  `Supplying and retrieving AWS credentials <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html>`_.

AWS Java code examples
======================

The **javav2** folder in this repository contains examples of complete use cases, and AWS service-based code examples.

Use cases
---------

In the **use_cases** folder, find step-by-step development tutorials that use multiple AWS services. By following these tutorials, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to create Java-based applications that use the AWS SDK for Java V2. Most of these AWS SDK for Java V2 tutorials use the Synchronous Java client.

If you are interested in using the Asynchronous Java client, see one of these tutorials:

AWS service examples
--------------------

The AWS service-specific Java examples are located in the **example_code** folder. The examples are divided into directories by AWS service (**s3**, **sqs**, and so on). Within
each, you'll find a **pom.xml** file used for building the examples with Maven.


Build and run the service examples
==================================

Build the examples using  Apache Maven or Gradle
------------------------------------------------

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Apache Maven or Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Java projects. For more information,  
see "Get started with the AWS SDK for Java 2.x" located at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html.

**Note:** Add the POM file you find in a service-specific folder to the POM file in the project. Then create a package that you find in the examples and you can start adding the Java classes to your project.

Build the examples from the command line
-----------------------------------------

To build any of the service examples, open a command-prompt (terminal) window and change to the directory containing the examples
you want to build or run. Then type::

   mvn package

You can use the Apache Maven Shade Plugin to package your JAR file with the artifacts in an uber JAR, which consists of all dependencies required to run the project. Ensure that the POM file has the required plugin to build the JAR with the dependencies.


    <plugin>
       <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>

       <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>

       <version>3.0.0</version>

       <executions>

       <execution>

       <phase>package</phase>

       <goals>

       <goal>shade</goal>

       </goals>

       </execution>

       </executions>

       </plugin>



For example, if you execute this command from the **s3** directory, you will find a JAR file named **S3J2Project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar** in the **target** folder.

Or, if you have **make**, you can begin the build process by typing::

   make

Maven will download any dependencies (such as components of the AWS SDK
for Java) that it needs for building.

Once the examples are built, you can run them to see them in action.

.. note:: If you are running on a platform with **make**, you can also use the provided Makefiles to
   build the examples, by running **make** in any directory with a **Makefile** present. You must
   still have Maven installed, however (the Makefile wraps Maven commands).


Run the service examples
------------------------

**IMPORTANT**

   The examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified
   credentials, and you may incur AWS service charges by running them. See the `AWS Pricing
   <https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/>`_ page for details about the charges you can expect for a given
   service and operation.

   Some of these examples perform *destructive* operations on AWS resources, such as deleting an
   Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table. **Be very careful** when running an operation that
   may delete or modify AWS resources in your account. It's best to create separate test-only
   resources when experimenting with these examples.

Because you built the JAR file that contains the dependencies, you can run an example using the following command. For example, you can run an S3 Java V2 example using this command:

          java -cp target/S3J2Project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.s3.ListObjects mybucket

For systems with Bash support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an alternative to setting the **CLASSPATH** and specifying the full namespace of the class to
run, we've included a **bash** script, **run_example.sh**, that you can use on Linux, Unix, or OS X
(or on Windows by using `Cygwin <https://www.cygwin.com/>`_, `MingW <http://www.mingw.org/>`_, or
`Bash on Ubuntu on Windows <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about>`_).

You can execute **run_example.sh** as shown::

    ./run_example.sh S3BucketOps

This runs the `S3BucketOps <example_code/s3/src/main/java/com/example/s3/S3BucketOps.java>`_
example (assuming that you've built the examples first).

If the example requires arguments, pass the argument list in quotation marks::

  ./run_example.sh S3BucketOps "<arg1> <arg2> <arg3>"
